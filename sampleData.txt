Psalm 144 Part 3 - Poem by Isaac Watts
Source: http://www.poemhunter.com/poems/happy/page-1/531532/

v.12-15 
L. M.
Grace above riches; or, The happy nation.
Happy the city where their sons,
Like pillars round a palace set,
And daughters, bright as polished stones,
Give strength and beauty to the state.
Happy the country where the sheep,
Cattle, and corn, have large increase;
Where men securely work or sleep,
Nor sons of plunder break the peace.
Happy the nation thus endowed,
But more divinely blest are those
On whom the all-sufficient God
Himself with all his grace bestows. 


Happy The Man - Poem by John Dryden
Source: http://www.poemhunter.com/poems/happy/page-1/425456/

Happy the man, and happy he alone,
He who can call today his own:
He who, secure within, can say,
Tomorrow do thy worst, for I have lived today.
Be fair or foul or rain or shine
The joys I have possessed, in spite of fate, are mine.
Not Heaven itself upon the past has power,
But what has been, has been, and I have had my hour. 


A Cradle Song - Poem by William Blake
Source: http://www.poemhunter.com/poems/happy/page-1/50234/

Sweet dreams form a shade,
O'er my lovely infants head.
Sweet dreams of pleasant streams,
By happy silent moony beams
Sweet sleep with soft down.
Weave thy brows an infant crown.
Sweet sleep Angel mild,
Hover o'er my happy child.
Sweet smiles in the night,
Hover over my delight.
Sweet smiles Mothers smiles,
All the livelong night beguiles.
Sweet moans, dovelike sighs,
Chase not slumber from thy eyes,
Sweet moans, sweeter smiles,
All the dovelike moans beguiles.
Sleep sleep happy child,
All creation slept and smil'd.
Sleep sleep, happy sleep.
While o'er thee thy mother weep
Sweet babe in thy face,
Holy image I can trace.
Sweet babe once like thee.
Thy maker lay and wept for me
Wept for me for thee for all,
When he was an infant small.
Thou his image ever see.
Heavenly face that smiles on thee,
Smiles on thee on me on all,
Who became an infant small,
Infant smiles are His own smiles,
Heaven & earth to peace beguiles. 

Retirement - Nancy Trew
Source: http://www.familyfriendpoems.com/poem/retirement

It's not it's knocked up to be, 
this thing we look so forward to.
A time of life that's worry free, 
so much time and things to do. 
But wait a minute, something's wrong, 
things aren't as they should be. 
The money is short, the month is long, 
and so much time on my hands for me.
I'm not as spry as I once was, 
a lot of my energy has wasted away. 
I have some bad days as everyone does, 
and take life as it comes, day by day. 
This system is backwards to me it seems,
we should retire first, and work last. 
Then in our youth, chase our dreams, 
all life's expectations surpassed.



Depression Never Ending - Sarah Boston

Source: http://www.familyfriendpoems.com/poem/depression-never-ending

Depression is here everyday
And it never goes away
Go away! I yell into the dark
As if someone is there
I feel as if I'm a prisoner
In the dungeon's lair
And as always no one cares
Do I dare?
Dare to care about anyone but me?
Could it be,
Someone there?
Someone there to care?
No, just an image
That's the way it will always be
No matter how hard I try
I just want to get by
I go through life day by day,
I thought pain was supposed
To go away with time
But it's not
It's still here
Here with the fear
Fear that I will get hurt more
